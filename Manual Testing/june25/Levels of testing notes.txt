Levels of testing:
1.Unit testing  -->Done by developers

Unit  ---> It is the smallest testable part of the s/w
Unit Testing-->   Testing the individual part of the s/w app
Dev --->Write the code/exe the code
Done by developers.
In programming, Unit means the Smallest block of code.
It comes under white box testing.
main()            un()
{                 {
------
------
}                }

Ex:
Login
UN:  
PWD:
Login:    --->Testing the individual unit   --->UT   

2.Integration testing

Once all the units gets tested
Integrating ---> Combining the 2 or more logically related modules to check the data connectivity b/w the modules

Ex:  In gmail, login,home page and compose email  -->U want to integrate these 3 modules

navigating from 1 w/w to other w/w  -->here we can check data conn  -->Login to home page navigation

Ex: PAyment gate way  -->  if u select any upi -->from the application(amazon/zomato) --> it will navigates to 3rd party appl(phonepe,gpay,paypal)
API -->Application PRogramming interface call -->Invoke this code -->so that data connection happens
It is done by either developers or testers. It is done rarely by testers

Approaches:
1.Big bang
2.Incremental

Bigbang:
All the units gets integrated at once.
So fault localisation is difficult and testers have to wait until all the modules gets developed.


Incremental approach:
Here if any modules not available they will use dummy modules called stub and driver.
Stub and driver do not implement entire programming logic but it just simulate the data connectivity between the modules.

Top down approach:
They will use stub if any low level module is not avaialble

Bottom up approach:
They will use driver if any high level module is not available

sandwich approach:
They will use both stub and driver(combination of both top down and bottom up approach)

System testing:
Once all the units gets integrated testing the application is tested as a whole from end to end is called system testing.
It is done by testers.
It comes under black box testing.

Acceptance testing
It is done for customer acceptance.
Internal Acceptance Testing : (Alpha Testing)
Testing which is done at developers site.
External Acceptance testing: (Beta Testing)
Testing which is done at end user site.
